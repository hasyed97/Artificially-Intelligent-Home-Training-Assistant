## Problem Statement 
Regular physical exercise decreases the danger of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular hazards, but in spite of the advantages of regular exercise, the vast majority struggle to keep up a consistent workout routine. This disappointment is regularly seen because of the absence motivation and feedback. One approach to handle lack of inspiration or motivation is through performance tracking.
## Available Solution
While the vast majority of those solutions center around expensive wearable computing devices
(e.g., FitBit, Apple Watch) for tracking cardio activities, for example, running and cycling. However
it does not change the fact that a wearable is generally connected to one piece of the body, tracks
just that area, and is lacking for catching a wide range of workout exercises, particularly when
different limbs are included.
## Proposed Solution
An Artificially Intelligent performance tracking Android app that acts as a personal fitness trainer
for an amateur who wants to keep a track of his/her fitness, even from the comfort of one's home.
The app uses deep learning pipeline to classify the exercises and prepares repitition counts per
exercise for its user's training program.
